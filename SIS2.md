Task description.
Students are required to implement a simple news feed screen that displays a list of posts,
each containing text and images. The following requirements must be met:
● Use mock data (no database or external API).
● The list of posts must be implemented using RecyclerView.
● Images must be loaded via their URL (not from local drawable resources).
● Each post must include at least text content and an image.
● The app must support state saving (e.g., when the device is rotated, the data and
interactions remain intact).
● Users should be able to like a post.
● Information about likes must persist during state changes (the liked/unliked state
should not reset).
Interactivity beyond the like feature (e.g., navigation, animations) is NOT required.
