SIS 3 Assignment (5 points)
Task description.
Students are required to implement a simple Android application demonstrating navigation
between two screens with data transfer. The project may be built from scratch or by
extending the previous assignment.
Requirements:
● The application must use Fragments for both screens; Navigation Component (with a
Navigation Graph) to handle navigation and data passing; XML-based UI layouts
(Jetpack Compose is not allowed).
● The first screen (Fragment A) should act as a main page, containing some data (e.g.,
a list of items, a form, or buttons).
● When the user interacts with an element on the main page, the app should navigate
to Fragment B, passing data (for example, a title, description, or image URL) through
Safe Args or Bundle arguments.
● The second screen (Fragment B) should display the received data clearly.
Interactivity beyond navigation is NOT required and will not be evaluated.
Evaluation Criteria.
The assignment will be graded based on the following components:
1. Correct use of Fragments (1 point)
2. Implementation of Navigation Component (2 points)
3. Passing data between Fragments (1 point)
4. Theoretical Question (1 point)
   a. One question related to concepts covered in the week 6 lecture.
   Deadline: Week 7.
   Bonus Points: Students can earn +1 bonus point by answering an additional theoretical
   question related to any topic covered in previous lectures
